<PlatformId>7</PlatformId>
<Platform>Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</Platform>
<ReleaseDate>06/14/1986</ReleaseDate>
<Overview>Vs. Super Mario Bros., is nearly a separate game in its own right. This game, one of several made for Nintendo's NES-based arcade cabinet, the Nintendo Vs. Unisystem (and its variant, Nintendo Vs. Dualsystem), is based on Super Mario Bros., and has an identical format. This game is harder than the original Super Mario Bros., with fewer warp zones and power-ups, and more enemies. The stages are different; the early stages are subtly different, with small differences like the omission of 1-up mushrooms and other hidden items, narrower platforms and more dangerous enemies, but six later stages are changed entirely. Many of these later, changed stages reappeared in the 1986 game, Super Mario Bros. 2 (Japan).

The plot is the same as the original Super Mario Bros., featuring Mario (or Luigi) setting out on a quest to free Princess Toadstool from the evil Bowser and restore the fallen kingdom of the Mushroom People.</Overview>

<ReleaseDate>01/01/2004</ReleaseDate>
<Overview>As of 2006, this is hailed as one of the greatest NES hacks of all time. This Super Mario Brothers 3 hack changes the game right down to the core by tweaking the actual game engine itself! 

Aside from the ‘typical’ graphics and text changes, this hack alters musical melodies, a full line up of all new levels, new power ups, new abilities for Mario, and even new enemies! When I say new, I’m not talking about changed graphics; I’m talking about completely new power ups and monsters. Money mushrooms, invisible Mario, time stopping potions, Kuribo shoes in any level that don’t disappear, shy guys that create projectiles, heat seeking bullet bills, and others are just the beginning of the changes made to this game. 

On top of that, you have random weather patterns on every stage, boss battles on every stage, and infinite lives, so your coins go to more useful purposes. They will be used to buy items from Toad’s house and get some level exits to appear. Let’s not forget stored, and switchable, power ups such as those found in Super Mario World! 

This description really doesn’t do this hack justice. It’s certainly impressive to say the least. Just download it and try it out! It’s definitely one of the most advanced SMB3 hacks to date and pretty darn fun as well!</Overview>

<Overview>This hack was created to celebrate the entire year of Luigi. It was intended to be released on the last day of the Year of Luigi and created well in advance, but poor Luigi was pipped to the post again by himself this time, when Nintendo announced his upcoming game in NES Remix 2. This hack is different to Nintendo’s recently announced Super Luigi Bros. Luigi will not jump higher than he originally felt like and he will not traverse the stages in reverse. All coin blocks now bear a commemorative 30th anniversary badge and Player Two is adorned in classic Luigi’s blue overalls. The title screen is also slightly different. Despite Luigi’s best efforts, picking up a power flower will still attribute fire Mario’s palette.</Overview>

This is one of the more well-known examples of pirate ports to the NES, as it comparatively manages to retain most of the elements that defined the SNES original without sacrificing too much quality.</Overview>

<Overview>Many years ago there was a very cool hack called “Mario Fantasy Adventure”, which was apparently originally made by Acmlm. However, while there was some awesome music and graphic work done on the hack, the hack was unfinished and the changes only lasted up until the first temple. 

This hack continues the Mario Fantasy Adventure and changes the characters, monsters, and other graphics through the entire game. Every monster and weapon has been modified. 

The character classes have also been completed (there were 2 Toads and 2 Peachs). You now pick from: Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Toad, Peach and Daisy and they all have corresponding class upgrades as well.</Overview>

<Overview>After losing a confrontation against Super Commandos Mad Dog and Scorpion, the juices of destruction drip from the spiked tongue of the vile alien warmonger - Red Falcon. Now, he's coming back stronger than ever, with a sinister plan that includes having his intergalactic warriors seep into the brains of the U.S. Army. To support his disguised forces of doom, he's recruited Jagger Froid, a demented alien from the Black Hole Galaxy. He's also shuttled in The Babula Destructoid Mechanism with its Beam of Death. With torrential terror about to rain down upon civilization, Earth's only hope rests with you, Scorpion, and your pal, the Dogster. And if your spread guns, lasers, flame throwers and mega shells fail to destroy Red Falcon's eight levels of terror, including radioactive lava fields, it's all over but for the shouting, the screaming and the cries from a disintegrating world!</Overview>

<ReleaseDate>07/22/1993</ReleaseDate>
<Overview>The lost colony of Alterra is a completely man-made lifeworld abandoned long ago in a nearby galaxy. Alterra is actually five colonies in one. Each self-contained habitat has been separately bio-engineered by a powerful ecosystem generation network known as a Multiple Organism Unit Link. MORGUL, for short. Early colonists used MORGUL to render Alterra inhabitable. But a cataclysmic quake severed all system interface functions, and MORGUL murderously rebelled. The few colonists lucky enough to escape told a grim tale of a higher intelligence gone berserk.

For generations, mankind sought a return to Alterra. Finally, genetic science created a saviour: Turrican, a mutant warrior, bio-engineered for the task of planetary reclamation. In the meantime, MORGUL has diligently twisted Alterran life forms to his brutal, destructive purposes. Thus, Turrican's challenges consist in eliminating hostile organisms from Alterra's five multi-level worlds and, finally, destroying the three faces of MORGUL.</Overview>

<Overview>Super Team Games is a side scrolling game where two players compete in races on an obstacle course. The game utilizes the Nintendo Power Pad; to control your on screen character you will need to run in place on the Power Pad to make your character run, and actually jump to make him jump. In the basic game you need to run and jump your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race. Several cooperative games are included as well, including a tug of war, relay race, and six legged race.</Overview>

<Platform>Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</Platform>
<ReleaseDate>08/26/1988</ReleaseDate>
<Overview>Super Dyna'mix Badminton is the first game for the Famicom to cover the sport of badminton. It was created by the developer/publisher team Pax Softnica and Vap Inc., previously behind Super Real Baseball '88.

The game is depicted by a side-view, more commonly associated with volleyball video games than tennis video games, the latter favoring a viewpoint from behind one of the competitors. This comparison is also true for the sport of badminton itself, which has a similar focus on performing hard-to-counter spike attacks close to the net in order to score points. Because of the irregular flight path of a shuttlecock, the player needs to focus more on its shadow than the projectile itself in order to play effectively.

Though the game has options for both male and female characters every character sprite is the same androgynous black-haired person. The only real change is that games are shorter for female competitors as they would be in real life. The game also allows for four different "coats" on the main menu - as these change the venue the competitors are playing in, this is presumably a mistranslation of "courts".</Overview>

<Overview>A train-based boardgame for the PC Engine, Famicom, and Game Boy.

Super Momotarou Dentetsu is a train and conveyance-based board game with financial elements that features Hudson's Momotarou character, based on the Japanese folklore hero of the same name. It is the second game in the Momotarou Dentetsu series and the first to be released on a 16-bit console - the PC Engine - hence the "Super" in the title. Several years after its PC Engine release, Super Momotarou Detetsu was also released on the Nintendo Famicom and Game Boy. It received a sequel in Super Momotarou Dentetsu II and a large number of successors.

The goal of the game is to travel the map and acquire territory through business deals, similar to Monopoly or Itadaki Street. Players have to contend with each other for limited resources, as well as CPU threats like the God of Poverty.</Overview>

There are some inaccuracies in the game, mainly with the birthdates of some of the wrestlers, and Big Van Vader's hometown and date of birth are not listed in order to protect his gimmick. The only two wrestlers to appear in both Super Star Pro Wrestling and WCW Wrestling are Road Warrior Hawk and Road Warrior Animal.</Overview>

<GameTitle>Super Real Baseball '88</GameTitle>
<PlatformId>7</PlatformId>
<Platform>Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</Platform>
<ReleaseDate>07/30/1988</ReleaseDate>
<Overview>Super Real Baseball '88 (スーパーリアル ベースボール '88?) is a baseball game developed by Pax Softonica for the Famicom and published in Japan by Vap in 1988. After Namco excited the market for baseball games with the release of Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, many other companies attempted to meet the demand for more baseball games.

This title differentiated itself from other baseball games by obtaining permission from the Professional Baseball Organization of Japan to use the official names of the 12 Japanese baseball teams and their players. This was a groundbreaking feature at the time. It was also the first game to depict an existing stadium with it's actual name, the Tokyo Dome, which had just opened shortly before the game's release. Outfielder and first baseman Warren Cromartie, formerly with the Montreal Expos, and playing for the Yomiuri Giants at the time, was chosen to help promote the game.

To further distinguish the game, the developers chose to use a more realistic approach when depicting the players on the field, as opposed to the more cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball games. Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird's eye view of the field. Despite these changes, and efforts to promote the game, it was considered very difficult to play, as it employed rather complex controls for batting, pitching, and fielding that were not easy for many players to perform.</Overview>

<Platform>Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</Platform>
<ReleaseDate>04/22/1994</ReleaseDate>
<Overview>The game itself is interesting, with ten teams to choose from, and multiple game modes including an actual tournament or penalty kick practicing.

For the PK Battle modes, each player must select a different team. He must then scan a player card (not a team card), and then that player will have a chance to kick a penalty kick (if it is his turn). For all other modes, the player must scan a team card and that will be the team that he will play as for the game(s). The main mode of play is the J.LEAGUE mode, of course. It is set up in a season/tournament setting, with 18 games per team. There are ten teams total in this version of J.League, and they are randomly sorted to play against a different team each day. The games are split into two periods with three minutes (3:00) apiece. Prior to starting a game, the player can choose the formation of his eleven active players, from one of three layouts that he can see on the small screen (4-4-2, 4-3-3, or 3-5-2).</Overview>

The hack aims to update the game to be more enjoyable today with revised game design and improved graphics, while trying to maintain the original concept and feel of exploration intact. I have tried to keep the level design the same too, otherwise it just wouldn’t be the same game. There are just a few differences here and there, see if you can spot them.

-Completely new graphics
-Completely new songs
-Items are not invisible anymore
-Warps are now doors you can enter
-The HUD shows important item collection progress
-Some bugs have been fixed
    Improved performance</Overview>

The game supported up to four players on one match at a time; # Nintendo World Cup, a soccer game where you (and a friend) chose to represent a team and played several matches until you won the World Cup. The game featured little to no rules, which means that you could hit your opponents as much as you want, without fear of the Ref getting in the way. Both games were compatible with the included Four Score NES multiplayer adapter.</Overview>
